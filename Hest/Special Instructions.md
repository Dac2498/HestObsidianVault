Please sort your articles into folders. 

All images should be stored in the "Pictures" folder. Please feel free to add subfolders if needed

This Vault will be used openly by Both Drew and Ethan for world development. Neither should snoop around for the purpose of spoiling story. Articles that are expressly forbidden will be tagged '-d' if Drew is the owner or '-e' if Ethan is the owner. Do not click on a link with a tag until it has been untagged.

Use common sense for changes to articles you did not write. If you want to make a significant change to an article you did not origionally author, chat with the author. For example, if Ethan wants to make changes to the Syndacate of the 4 to make it the Syndacate of the 5, that is a welcome change but should be discussed before implamentation.
