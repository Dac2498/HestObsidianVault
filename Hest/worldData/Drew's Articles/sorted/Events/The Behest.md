The Behest was the event where the gods created the planet [[Hest]] and the [[Moon]].

In the beginning, there were [[the Primoridals:]] the first [[Gods]] of the universe. They conflicted one another ruling among the same plane, and quickly segmented the universe into its first 4 planes.

  

[[The Primordials]]  
[[Luc]], the god of light, created the plane of light,

[[Nox]], the god of dark, created the plane of dark,  
[[Tem]], the god of time, created the plane of time,

[[Cor]], the god of space, created the plane of space.

  

With their planes separated, they were content in their devine rule, but the creation of these new planes caused an unbalance where they met, an unbalance that resulted in intense chaos and unknowing. To contain the unbalance, [[The Primordials]] created 4 new gods, [[the Elementals]], who would be the engineers of a solution to the unbalance and gave them unique planes as well. Together, [[The Primordials]] and [[the Elementals]] found a solution, the unbalance could be contained if a plane of balance was created in the center of their planes.  
  
[[the Elementals]]

[[Embis]], God of fire,

[[Hyris]], god of water,

[[Ventis]], god of air,

[[Teris]], god of earth.

  
Each gave a part of themselves in an event called “The Behaft.” [[the Elementals]] first made Haft, a combination of each of their forces which molded together into the planet and a moon to keep it contained. Then, [[The Primordials]] made a plane for the planet to sit in, [[the material plane]]. [[Luc]] made [[the Fae Realm]], a realm of light and joy, while [[Nox]] made [[the Ethereal realm]], a plane of darkness and despair.

[[Tem]] and [[Cor]] agreed to regulate their powers within [[the material plane]], creating a consistent defined time and space.  
  
All of the cosmic energies thrown together all at once in The Behest created 4 new [[Gods]], [[The Celestials]]. [[The Celestials]] were then given planes, but the universe was out of balance again, since there were new planes without a change to the balance in [[the material plane]]. So,

  

[[The Celestials]]

[[Virian]], the god of life, created life

[[Houden]], the god of death, created death

[[Do-ti]], the god of order, established the rules for life

[Do-rah], the god of chaos, established variation in life

  

And it worked. The universe was at balance. After some time, [[The Celestials]] grew bored of their new existence, and grouped together to create sentient life and 4 new [[Gods]] to rule over them, granting each a plane.  
  
[[The Primevals]]

[[Thorrin]], the god of knowledge,

[[Esca]], the god of trickery,

[[Borok]], the god of War,

[[Del]], the god of Peace.

  

Angered at this new creation, [[The Primordials]] and  [[the Elementals]] used their power together to prevent any more changes to [[Hest]] by the hands of the[[ Gods]]. They also prevented any new planes to be created. From this moment on, life was on [Hest], and the [[Gods]] had little control.

  

Each god realized that they themselves had limited control in [[Hest]], but they could create [[Lesser Gods]] who live in their realms to hold more control. These [[Gods]] would not be near as powerful as the 16 [[Major gods]], but they are still devine entities. This is where more specific [[Gods]] sit, gods like the god of the harvest, the god of the moon, the god of the forge, etc. however, each lives in the realm of a major god. 

  

Today, there are thousands of [[Lesser Gods]], each with their own purpose, some good some evil, and some with no alignment whatsoever. Some have temples with large followings, while others are unheard of.
