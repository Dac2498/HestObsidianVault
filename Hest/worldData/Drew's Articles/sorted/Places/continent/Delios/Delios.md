The Continent of Delios is a vast expanse of mostly forest lands. Temperate forests are broken in the north by cold taiga, while the south is speckled with marshes and wetlands. The Island in the south west of the continent contains the Dyladad desert, a peculiar desert surrounded by ocean.  
  
It is said that eons ago, the gods were not happy with the continent and split it in two, introducing a strait that is now known as the heavens blade Strait. In the south is the continent of Thoriland, a large continent that holds the two rainforest nations of Alas-Udan and Gizarad.  
  
The Nations of Delios  
[[The Zadian Empire]]:

Led by elven King Gailen Zahdia, The Zadian empire is a large empire that has conquered the entire continent at one point in time. Starting as a small kingdom in the south east, the Conqueror king Zahdia went kingdom to kingdom uniting the land. After taking most of the continent, He went south into theÂ  Dyladad desert to complete his conquest. Thinking it would be an easy land to conquer, he went in quickly and overzealous, being killed in battle in the desert. Though the empire claims the island, it does not recognize the rule of the empire and has since split into individual tribes.  
  
King Zahdia promoted the purity of the elves, and the tolerance of elvenlike species while other races were socially forced out to the eastern part of the continent. The Zahdian empire is primarily Humans, Elves, and Dwarves, and while other races do live and work there, they have a much harder life than their more elvenlike counterparts.  
  
Over time, The Zadian empire began to fall, leading to the other nations claiming independence. Our story will begin with a weaker empire that is being broken into smaller nations. Starting with the more accepting lands in the eastern part of the empire.

  

[[The Kingdom of Halestrom]] - More northern, it has a colder climate that focuses on fur hunting as a main export.  
The Vexel Coast - Formerly a part of the Halestrom kingdom, the Vexel Coast is a collection of successful trade cities that facilitate the trade between the two halves of the continent.

[[The united tribes of Hallowood]] - A more tribal area, The united tribes is a council of racial tribes of specific races that have taken hold of the forests.

[[Kowak]] - Absorbing the wetlands in the south, Kowak is a collection of the more greedy and independent members of the forests and has a large community of goblins, hobgoblins and gnolls.  
Bliston - Bliston is a forest nation of united provinces. Many scholars from other parts of the world see Bliston as the next great empire of the continent.

[[Hethenrun]] - Mainly forest and taiga, Hethenrun is a primarily human population that serves as a port for international trade in mined materials, as the continent does not have much access to mines.

[[Dyladad Desert]] - once united, the tribes of the Dyladad Desert have a rich culture that outsiders rarely understand. The conditions make it very hard for outsiders to survive, and the culture makes them feel even more secluded
