Hushar is a human Artificer, smith, and volunteer guard for the small town of [[Lost Peak]]. He lives and works out of his privatly owned Smithy, [[Mahun's Smithy]], located in the western part of the town.

Hushar used to be an adventurer before his party found the town of [[Lost Peak]] under attack from some surprisingly ferocious wildlife. After the party defeated the opposing forces, wounds were healed by [[Stella Cliffhopper]], in her inn, [[The Keeper's Stay Inn]]. learing that the town had been plagued with simular attacks for some time, Hushar decided to set up shop in the town and help improve the defences of the [[The Zadian Hand]] stationed in the city while his party moved on to find their own path.

Nowadays, Hushar acts as a bit of a leader for the town of [[Lost Peak]] and, since the town is stationed just a a crossroads of two major roads, makes his living selling magical items and enchanting armor for adventurers and soldiers traveling through the town. As a badgeholder of the [[Geartooth Collective]], he also established a branch in the city to aid in the townsfolk learning crafts and artificery, now known as the [[Lost Peak Geartooth Collective]].

He is always joined by [[Tooth]], his steel defender.
