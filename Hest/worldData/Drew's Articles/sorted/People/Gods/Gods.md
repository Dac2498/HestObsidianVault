 The Gods of [[Hest]] are split into 3 major groups, The [[Major gods]], The [[Lesser Gods]], and [[Patron Gods]]. [[Major gods]] and [[Lesser Gods]] live in the [[16 Realms]] that surround the [[Mortal Planes]], while the [[Patron Gods]] live amoung the [[Mortal Planes]].

The Gods created the world in an event called [[The Behest]], and now reign as the deities over the world.
