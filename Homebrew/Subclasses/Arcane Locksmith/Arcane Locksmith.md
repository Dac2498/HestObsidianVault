Arcane Locksmiths are seekers, intensely curious souls who seeks to plumb the depths of the universe. To an arcane locksmith, the magical and the mundane are on and the same, the laws of physics, the rhythms of the cosmos, and the unseen currents of magic all parts of the vast fabric of reality. 

Unlike most artificers, who use magic to enhance material weapons, armor, and other objects, Arcane Locksmiths seek to better understand magic and the nature of reality through their physical craft. Unlike Wizards, who seek knowledge through tomes and scrolls, the Arcane Locksmith's study is kinetic and experiential. Things like locks, doors, gates, and keys have powerful magical analogs and antecedents; as such, locksmithing itself can help hone the intellect for probing into the mysteries of the universe. To the Arcane Locksmith, all of reality, including people and events, can be seen as a series of puzzles to be solved, a series of locks needing the right key. The wise Locksmith knows that even several lifetimes of work and study will only lead to a fraction of the total understanding available, and they are thrilled even by that small fraction. 

**Expanded Spell List**
3rd Level:
- Chaos Bolt
	- Narratively, the caster is "unlocking" a small part of the fabric of reality that allows chaotic, sub-real energy to impact the target. When chaos bolt's leaping effect occurs, it is the threads of reality continuing to unravel.
- Earth Tremor
	- The caster uses arcane energy to tinker with tectonic forces, picking the ground like the tumblers of a lock.

**3rd Level Feature**
You can cast Arcane Lock without preparing it. You do not need to use a spell slot to cast it, but may only cast it without using a spell slot once per long rest.

*Master Key* 
3rd-Level Feature
As part of a long rest, you spend time using tinker's tools to produce a "master key." You need some sort of metal to do this (a previous master key can also be recycled to this purpose). The key can take one of the following forms:
	- Heart Key: *You pour into your key all your knowledge of social interaction. People, after all, are just another puzzle to figure out.* While your Heart Key is on your person, you are proficient in either persuasion or insight. If you are already proficient in the skill you choose, you gain expertise.
	- Skeleton Key: *You primarily use the craft of locksmithing to gain insight on the inner workings of the universe. The reinforcement of knowledge, however, is a two-way street, and the sublime informs your understanding of the mundane as well. To make a skeleton key, you use all your knowledge of locks, both material and supra-material.* When using your skeleton key, you make a Dexterity check and add your proficiency bonus, as a rogue does, but your key also aids you in breaching the lock. You may roll a d6 and add it to the check. This ability can be used four times per long rest.
	- Key of Contention: *Though most locksmiths have never seen combat, you are no stranger to strife; the battle between a lockmaker and a keymaker is its own kind of arms race.* 
		You fashion a key that excels in unlocking sources of power and turning battles to your advantage. When rolling initiative with a Key of Contention on your person, turn the key (you decide what this looks like narratively). Then roll a d8 for one of the following outcomes:
			1-3: You unlock a ley line, and you and your allies become charged with eldritch energy. When attacking, you may roll a d4 and add it to either the attack roll or the damage roll. When adding to the damage roll, the d4 counts as radiant damage.
			4-6: Choose an enemy. Your key unlocks something within that enemy and they are mystically destabalized. They have disadvantage on constitution and dexterity saving throws, and their armor class is decreased by 1.
			7-8: Your key frees...something. Roll a d8 and see the **Unleash** table to find out what. The being you unleash may be hostile to your party if it normally would be, or it may be grateful to you for releasing it and  focus on attacking your enemies. You may choose the point at which it appears up to 30 feet from you.
