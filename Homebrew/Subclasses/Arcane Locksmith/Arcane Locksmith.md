Arcane Locksmiths are seekers, intensely curious souls who seeks to plumb the depths of the universe. They may be wizards tired of burying themself in books, thieves drawn to the art of making and breaking locks, or longtime artisans seeking deeper knowledge. To an arcane locksmith, the magical and the mundane are one and the same, the laws of physics, the rhythms of the cosmos, and the unseen currents of magic all parts of the vast fabric of reality. 

Unlike most artificers, who use magic to enhance material weapons, armor, and other objects, Arcane Locksmiths seek to better understand magic and the nature of reality through their physical craft. Unlike Wizards, who seek knowledge through tomes and scrolls, the Arcane Locksmith's study is kinetic and experiential. Things like locks, doors, gates, and keys have powerful magical analogs and antecedents; as such, locksmithing itself can help hone the intellect for probing into the mysteries of the universe. To the Arcane Locksmith, all of reality, including people and events, can be seen as a series of puzzles to be solved, a series of locks needing the right key. The wise Locksmith knows that even several lifetimes of work and study will only lead to a fraction of the total understanding available, and they are thrilled even by that small fraction.

**Brute Force**
*3rd-Level Feature*
Sometimes the best way to open a lock is to hit it real hard. You gain proficiency with hammers of all types (light hammers, mauls, and warhammers). 

**Master Key** 
*3rd-Level Feature*
As part of a long rest, you spend time using tinker's tools to produce a "master key." You need some sort of metal to do this (a previous master key can also be recycled to this purpose). The key can only be used by its maker and must be remade whenever you take a long rest. The key can take one of the following forms:
- Heart Key: *You pour into your key all your knowledge of social interaction. People, after all, are just another puzzle to figure out.* While your Heart Key is on your person, you are proficient in either persuasion or insight. If you are already proficient in the skill you choose, you gain expertise.
- Skeleton Key: *You primarily use the craft of locksmithing to gain insight on the inner workings of the universe. The reinforcement of knowledge, however, is a two-way street, and the sublime informs your understanding of the mundane as well. To make a skeleton key, you use all your knowledge of locks, both material and supra-material.* When using your skeleton key, you make a check as though using thieves' tools, but your key also aids you in breaching the lock. You may roll a d6 and add it to the check. This ability can be used four times per long rest.
- Key of Contention: *Though most locksmiths have never seen combat, you are no stranger to strife; the battle between a lockmaker and a keymaker is its own kind of arms race.* You fashion a key that excels in unlocking sources of power and turning battles to your advantage. When rolling initiative with a Key of Contention on your person, turn the key (you decide what this looks like narratively). Then roll a d8 for one of the following outcomes:
	- 1-3: You unlock a ley line, and you and your allies become charged with eldritch energy. Each member of your party gains a d4, which can be added to either an attack roll or a damage roll. When adding to the damage roll, the d4 counts as radiant damage.
	 - 4-6: You tamper with the ground itself. Territory within a 30 foot radius of you becomes difficult terrain. You may use your bonus action to allow an ally to move through the terrain normally for one round. If you are on a plane other than the material plane, some terrain-based effect related to that plane of existence occurs, to be determined by your GM. 
	- 7-8: Your key frees...something. Roll a d8 and see the **Unleash** table to find out what. The being you unleash may be hostile to your party if it normally would be, or it may be grateful to you for releasing it and  focus on attacking your enemies. You may choose the point at which it appears up to 30 feet from you.

**Lock and Key**
*5th-level feature*
Your trade involves the making of locks as well as the making of keys, and your skill at cracking locks improves your skill at making them more secure in a recursive cycle. Similarly, making keys and probing the mystical for things to unlock has given you insight into binding up reality in new ways yourself, creating locks of your own. Twice per long rest, you can cast "Arcane Lock" without using material components or expending a spell slot.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with a hammer, it has a chance to unlock something within that creature. On a base attack roll (before modifiers or bonuses) of 18 or greater they are mystically destabalized. They have disadvantage on constitution and dexterity saving throws, and their armor class is decreased by 1.

**Ornate Keys**
*9th-level feature*
You gain proficiency with jeweler's tools, or another set of tools if you already have proficiency with jeweler's tools. When you fashion a Master Key during a long rest, you can use these tools to inlay it with gems. A Master Key adorned in this way is magically enhanced, with each type requiring different gems:
- Heart Key (500gp of ruby): With an adorned Heart Key on your person, you have proficiency in both persuasion and insight. If you have proficiency in either or both already, you gain expertise instead. Additionally, you have advantage on charisma-based checks and saving throws.
- Skeleton Key (500gp of sapphire): You may now roll a d10 when attempting to pick a lock with your skeleton key. You can use this ability 5 times per long rest. Your skeleton key also suppresses arcane locks for 1 minute, similar to the knock spell.
- Key of Contention (750gp of emerald): You and your allies now gain a d6 when you tap into a ley line, and difficult terrain created with your Key of Contention does not affect you or your allies. Any creature unleashed by your Key of Contention regards you either as an ally or its master.

**Keeper of Keys**
*15th-level feature*
- You may now possess two master keys at a given time. It takes one hour to create a second key. 
**Passer through Doorways**
*15th-level feature*
You have become adept at recognizing and manipulating the fabric of reality. As an action you may use a master key to pass through a Doorway. The key is consumed in the process. This Doorway can be a doorway to another plane of existence of your choosing, or it can be a doorway into another creature's mind. If the doorway is into an unwilling creature's mind, it makes a wisdom saving throw against your DC. If it suceeds, your key is still consumed and you gain no benefit.

When you enter a creature's mind through the Doorway, it is the same as if you were entering another plane of existence. Your body vanishes from the space you were previously occupying. When you enter a creature's mind, you instantly gain information about its armor class, attributes, and hitpoints. You also gain information as to its intentions and emotions, as well as its history. The GM may impose a check here to determine how much of its memory is available to you. All of this information should remain between you and the GM unless you are able to communicate it to your party in-world.

On each of the creature's turns, it may attempt to dispel you from its mind by making another wisdom saving throw against your spell save dc. Once inside the creature's mind, you may use your action to take control of the creature, similar to the Dominate spells. If you choose to dominate the creature, you decide what it does on its turn after its saving throw. For the rest of your turns while you are in the creature's mind, you may make checks to probe for information or use Arcane Lock to attempt to cement your hold on the creature's mind. For each use of Arcane Lock, the dc for the creature to dispel you from its mind increases by 1. 

While inside the creature's mind, you are immune to outside damage affecting the creature aside from psychic damage, which is divided evenly between the two of you. Additionally, you must make an intelligence saving throw each turn you are inside the creature's mind, contested by the creature's intelligence check. On a failure, you take 2d6 psychic damage.

If the creature successfully expels you or dies, or you are reduced to 0 hit points, you materialize in an unoccupied space adjacent to the creature.
