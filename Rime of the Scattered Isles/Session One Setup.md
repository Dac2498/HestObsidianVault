Lyra: 
You can see a long way from the Tower of the Moon in Riena. You can see all around the city. Those with the keenset vision claim to see clear across Sunset Bay to the northern peninsula.

Yesterday evening, you climbed the tower -- it's a public space, dedicated to the worship of Nos, as he's known in this part of the world -- to think/journal/read about swordsmanship/look at the view/whatever you want and noticed some clouds gathering to the northwest, out beyond the bay, far out at sea. No, not some clouds gathering, a huge wall of white. And gray.

And black.

This mass appeared to be getting larger, and soon you realized that a Typhoon unlike any you've even seen was headed straight for Riena. You did one of three things:

1. I descended the tower partway, leaving the most vulnerable part and finding a sheltered niche still well above the likely flood line. 
2. I went out into the city to raise the alarm and find someone I care about (a friend, a lover, a child you've some concern for, etc.) so I could try to keep them safe.
3. I stood at the top of the tower, waiting for the storm to come, daring the wind to throw me from the tower, savoring the bite of the rain into my skin.
She shelters in the lower portion of the tower. 

Minuet:
You're accustomed to the fine things, but you want things that are finer, and you want to secure your future. Port Glory is brimming with wealth sure, but as massive as it is, it ain't big enough for you and Madame Rivienne both. There are other cities in the world, other wealthy cities, other cities where your background and talents would be just as well received, and where there may be more opportunity for you to become a businesswoman in your own right. You've decided to start your search for a new home in Rienos, famous for its thriving trade that brings pleasures to one's doorstep, along with the coin to indulge in them. It might be just the place for you.

So you've chartered passage aboard the *Mothers' Pride* (the odd coincidence isn't lost on you) captained by Homund Lindstrom. Several days into the passage, you hear a cry from the crewman keeping watch in the crow's nest. You see him point off to the east and notice a line across the sky. At the same time you notice the water is quite choppy. Within half an hour the waves are swelling and a massive storm is bearing down on you. The *Mothers' Pride* is tossed about like a toy boat in a child's bath, you and the other passengers are belowdecks getting sick, meanwhile the crew has strung lines across the deck to keep from getting swept overboard. After what feels like hours of driving rain, wind that tears at the sails, and water running into the quarters where you and the rest of the passengers are huddled as the walls and the floor periodically change places, there is a sudden calm.

You step out onto the deck and instantly know what is happening; Marielle has studied weather patterns and told you some about them. You're in the eye of the hurricane, with just a brief, precious window of calm. You spend the time doing one of three things:

1. Writing a final letter to Marielle and stashing it in a bottle along with instructions for its delivery and some coin for carrying out the task.
2. Attempting to enliven and inspire Captain Lindstrom and the crew, all of whom look a little shaken.
3. Attempting to commune with your spirit "parent" and ask for guidance and/or protection.

- She writes the letter to Marielle and stashes it in a bottle. 
- A second trip through the eye wall of the hurrican proves too much for the *Mothers' Pride*. She sinks. Minuet released the bottle with her letter into the water. It finds its way to Rienos, unbeknownst to her.
- Minuet is surprised by the relative calm once she goes under, the blue/green of the sea stretching out before her as the salt stings her eyes. She hears a voice, indistinct, saying "I chose you out of the waters of the lake. I still choose you now, child. Perhaps you will learn to listen to me more often." When she comes to, she is floating on a slab of wood.

Vivian:

You know the sort of thing a pirate has to do to get hung in lawless San Rey, and you know Harland, so Port Glory is the more likely bet if he's in trouble. They'll hang a man for stealing an apple up in Aegeln, or so you've heard. Rueing the fact that you have to charter passage on someone else's ship, you nonetheless hand over a good portion of your savings to secure passage north on the *Boreal Bounty*. It seems like you're barely out of Sunset Bay when the storm hits, a hurricane unlike any you've witnessed before.

The sea wraps around the hull of the *Bounty* like it's embracing an old friend. Water washes across the deck two and three feet deep, threatening to take anyone without a firm grip on a rope, a railing, or one of the masts with it. A few other passengers are below, but you insist on being on deck with the crew. As the storm rages, another passenger, a male gnome with a green beard, steps onto the deck and shouts something at the nearest crewmember that sounds like a question, but the wind is too loud for you to tell. Suddenly, a wave sweeps him overboard, but he manages to cling on, barely. He is three paces from you, close enough that you could get to him in the second or so before the sea claims him for good, but not so close that you can keep your grip on the rigging that's kept you from suffering the same fate so far. What do you do?

- She saves the gnome and makes it back to the mast.
- The boat does not sink
- The gnome, whose name is Edgerrin Tormas, who profusely thanks Vivian for rescuing him as soon as the storm subsides, and then begins excitedly talking about how there may be others in the water, that they should search for lost souls from other ships and their own. Edgerrin casts Dancing Lights to help the search. As one of the crew starts to grouse that "The likelihood of happening to find someone out here is slim to..." the crewman in the crow's nest shouts "soul in the water, 30 yards starboard!"
