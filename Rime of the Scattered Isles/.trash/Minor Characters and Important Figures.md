- Arch Admiral Kashiri:
	Elf, F.
	One of the youngest to ever make full Admiral in the Hatorian navy at only 320, Admiral Kashiri is known for her tirelessness and relentless ambition. She has three fleets under her command, so it was a surprise when she was found leading a small expedition in the region of Capuchino and San Rey. See entry on [[Kavalok Sharpstone]].
