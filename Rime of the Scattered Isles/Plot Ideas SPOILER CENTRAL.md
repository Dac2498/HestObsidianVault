[[Lyralai]] and [[Kavalok Sharpstone|Kavalok]] are eventually "adopted" by Callixto. This could happen as [[Netari]] dies, either from illness, violence, or some kind of accident. She then, at Callixto's behest, becomes some kind of guardian spirit. This could all take place on the island known as Callisto. 

Callisto is Calixto's twin sister (or they could be two sides of one being). Calixto represents the deep water (bluewater) and Callisto represents the land/shore/brownwater. The underside of the island could reflect that it is Calixto's domain, although ultimately, his domain is the deeps. Netari could become a water spirit, *or* she could become part of the island, similar to the heart of Tefiti in Moana.

In this scene, Calixto's arrival will be heralded by all kinds of sea creatures: turtles, dolphins, sharks, jellyfish...all leading up to two plesiosaurs flanking Calixto's avatar....a huge Livyatan whale. It speaks, but only Lyra and Kavalok...or perhaps only Lyra, because she has the amulet, can understand it. It speaks with typical sperm whale echolocational *taks* that slam into the party, but Lyra hears the voice of Calixto. Still working out what her role would be distinct but linked to Kavalok as Calixto's Scion, and what function the amulet will have in general and relative to [[Calixto's Razor]].
