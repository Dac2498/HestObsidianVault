Zerinia was a moderately powerful Dark elf sorcerer living on San Rey. She was effectively run out of town by Capsize Kate due to facilitating the slave trade out of a small tavern she owned. Later she made a deal with [[Thalgal Sharpstone]] to find some way to enslave the island's Firbolg population. This was a difficult proposition for two reasons. First, the Firbolgs were highly isolated and able to remain inconspicuous due to their connection to the land. Second, the non-Firbolg residents of Toquemada and the rest of the island did not tolerate the slave trade, and would attack Sharpstone and his fleet on sight. A bear does not risk attacking a wolf; while victory is assured, grave injury is also a possibility. Toquemada, its residents, and the pirates that frequented the port were fearsome enough to take a large bite out of Sharpstone's forces in the event of any confrontation.

Zerinia's plan was brilliant. She had cultivated the friendship of a Firbolg druid named [[Corum]], from whom she learned of [[The Source]]. She began subtly poisoning the Source with magic. This in turn led to detrimental effects on the already fragile Firbolg society. She was then able to convince Corum that the people of Toquemada were responsible. Together they bent the Source to attack Toquemada with a pox.

The pox would weaken Toquemada enough for Sharpstone to risk an attack, while also ensuring the eventual crippling of the firbolg civilization.
