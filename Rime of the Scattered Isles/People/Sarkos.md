Ogre Captain of the [[Eternal Gale]]. 
Sarkos grew up in the hill country of central Rienos, in a very small ogre village. His people were not known for being sailors. Sarkos, however, wanted to see the world. On treks through the hills, he could sometimes spot the Sea of Eternity to the north or the Gulf of Rienos to the south.
Sarkos set out from home at the age of 14, already standing over eight feet tall.

He signed on to the [[Baxter Mariah]], a whale ship from [[Port Glory]] under the command of [[Lloris Beaufort]]. They had lost six crew members to a particularly vicious whale in the Sea of Eternity. Beaufort was skeptical of hiring an ogre, and most of the crew downright hostile to the idea. However, [[Helstrom Breakjaw]], the dwarven first mate, took a liking to Sarkos, and vouched for him. Soon, Cpn Beaufort and the rest of the crew came to see his worth as well, as he honed his skills with a harpoon and his strength when hauling ropes.

After some years on the *Baxter Mariah*, Sarkos grew restless again. He saved some money and bought a small fishing boat, docking in Mikos to avoid the bustling Sunset Bay. The deep sea, though, continued to call to him. He busted his ass and kept growing his operation, until finally he could afford a small Brigantine, which he christened the *Eternal Gale*. He gathered a crew, including Gorkos, his younger brother, and took up whaling again. They found some success, but this soon grew routine. It was around this time that scholars from the Empire began arriving in Rienos, searching for kraken remains. Every once in a while, one of the beasts would wash ashore somewhere, and the Hatorian scholars, as well as alchemists both Rieni and foreign, would descend on the corpse like a flock of crows. A quirky gnome fellow had even struck a deal with Sarkos to buy the remains of any giant squid left inside the bellies of the whales he caught.

Sarkos smelled a business opportunity. He would become Rienos' first -- and perhaps the world's first -- kraken hunter.

Reel In*

If the harpoon missed, the User may use a bonus action to reel it back in fully and regain the harpoon When a target is grappled by the harpoon launcher the user of the harpoon launcher may choose to reel them in with it as an attack, when they do this, if the target resists, the Target must make a Dexterity saving throw DC (8 + Dex + Proficiency if applicable). On a failed save the target takes 1d6 piercing damage, gets dragged 10 feet closer to the user, and falls prone.
