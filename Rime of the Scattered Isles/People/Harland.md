Harland is a caring and reliable man who is very protective of the things he cares about. He has a deep respect for the sea, so he joined a ship in order to explore as much of it as possible and to keep the waters protected (from disgusting beasts and such) so not only is he a well trained navigator/explorer, he is a decent fighter as well. He did not respect the captain of the Silver Fang because he was a drunk and didn't have respect for others or the sea. Harland struggled to be part of the ship and had a lot of guilt, but when Vivian came aboard, he was very protective of her and couldn't leave. He is dutiful , and known to tell dad jokes and be playful. He's light-hearted in life, but serious about his role in the world.
  
Harland's family is very sweet, but they are meek and mild and not adventurers, so he never felt like he fit in


Blamed in Toquemada for somehow causing the pox, because he is immune and tritons are uncommon.
