Half-goliath, half-tiefling brother of [[Lyralai]], son of [[Thalgal Sharpstone]] and [[Netari]]

- Acquisition of [[Calixto's Razor]]
	Late one evening, Thalgal Sharpstone's flagship spotted a sloop becalmed several leagues from Toquemada, chased it down under oars, and boarded it after a brief, one-sided exchange of cannon fire. The crew of the smaller boat fought fiercely, heedless of their certain defeat. Their captain proved to be none other than [[Arch Admiral Kashiri]]. While his father was engaged in a duel with the First Mate, an excellent elven swordsman, and the Boatswain, a squat, powerful orc wielding a whip and a handaxe, Kavalok found himself and the rest of the boarding party facing Kashiri. Her appearance had stopped them cold. She was taller than many of the men on board, with ink black hair that fell below her shoulders. Her eyes were as black as her hair, and she wore a high-necked tunic of black silk. Over the tunic she wore a breastplate of dark blue steel, inlaid with bands of gold, swirls of mother-of-pearl, and various gemstones. 

	Then there was the sword. It was a katana with a black blade and a handle wrapped in dark green leather. A jade inlay wound around the handle in the shape of a dragon. None of the boarding party was keen on being the first into the fray against one armed and arrayed such as Admiral Kashiri was, with the sort of countenance she possessed. None, that is, save Kavalok. Only 17, he charged with abandon, all the brazen confidence of youth fueling him. Steel rang against steel as he unleashed a flurry of blows upon the elven admiral. Kavalok was a blur of motion, a blaze of youthful energy; Kashiri, by contrast, seemed to move in slow motion, yet she parried every swing with ease. The other pirates were mesmerized. Kavalok stepped up his assualt, adrenaline coursing through him. He stood a full eight inches taller than Kashiri, and he was strong. The Admiral grew tired of merely fending him off. As the steel continued to sing, she waited for an opening. As the young pirate sent a downward stroke at her, she stepped back, intentionally leaving herself vulnerable to a counterthrust. When Kavalok lunged, she sidestepped at blinding speed, hair long hair scarcely seeming to move. The Goliath/Tiefling had overextended himself, and Kashiri slashed at his side with the katana. It cut through his clothing and bit deep, blood welling up between his ribs and a sharp pain flashing through him.
