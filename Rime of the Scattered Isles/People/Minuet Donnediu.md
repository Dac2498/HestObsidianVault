Aegelene Kalashtar Bard. Minuet was orphaned at a young age along with her little sister, [[Marielle Donnediu | Marielle]]. They were taken, as is customary in Aegeln, to the monastery in Lac Du Maman, where Minuet was eventually "adopted" by one of the spirits of the lake. Children are not allowed to leave the monastery until they are adopted; girls not adopted by the age of 12 are forced to become Sisters of the monastery and remain at Lac Du Maman permanently. Minuet waited for Marielle to be adopted, but as her 12th birthday approached, there was no sign. Finally Minuet fled the monastery with her sister and made her way to Port Glory.
