Halfling woman who ran an orphanage in Takata City serving the immigrant (non-elven) population at least as recently as 9 years ago. She is harsh and domineering. City authorities harassed her and saw the orphanage as a nuisance, not to mention funding was difficult. The same orphanage was once home to [[Vivian Wells]].

Whipped the children.
