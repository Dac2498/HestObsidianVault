Valhiri (Val for short- tiefling female captain of the [[Phantom]]. She is tough as nails, level-headed, but territorial. She takes her business very seriously because she knows that most men won’t take her seriously as a captain or competition (definitely a mistake) She leads an all female crew, something Vivian finds very inspiring. She’s never liked being on their bad side)
