- White barreled. Dark walnut handle.

Human Fighter -- Gunslinger

 She learned how to use guns while stowing away on a pirate ship in her youth. Now she loves them and tries to find new ways to make them even stronger 

Mulit-class into forge domain cleric for an extra boost to my guns. 
 Gives small magical abilities and can make magical ammo. Part of her weapons research 
 Can I make the spells look like different bullets when I shoot? How can we make this look mechanically cool when I do it? 

What kind of deity would a forge domain cleric have and why would Vivian subscribe to it? 

● Some kind of forge deity? Does that make sense in Ethan’s world? ● Appearance 

○ Age: 21 

○ Height: 5’ 9” 

○ Lean, athletic build (muscles from hard work, but does look a little underfed) ○ Dark red hair, sunkissed skin from years at sea, green eyes, black nails that she grease paints herself for her “image” 

○ Black pants, white ruffled shirt, black and gold vest and hat, black boots ○ Plenty of scars from hard work, a burn on her wrist. It’s in the shape of two fangs. It’s a brand from the crew (a punishment early on with her days on the silver fang)

● Background: 

○ Grew up in Miss Mildred’s Orphanage (not a fun place to be) 

The orphanage is located in Takata City. That’s where Vivian spent her childhood. It’s a busy city where the abuse of children would easily go unnoticed. 

She was left here by her parents who were simply too poor to take care of a child. It wasn’t out of any desire to give her up. They just couldn’t afford it. She never knew a life outside of the orphanage, so she built one in her mind. 

She told tales of sea adventures and beautiful sea creatures like swirling red dragons. She used to dream about stuff like this at night, and she’d tell the other girls about it as a way to keep them all sane (she believes this dream is a calling and wants to form a crew of her own) 

It’s a hard life with grueling chores and a bitchy headmistress who doesn’t let them have any fun. (Think of Anne with an E or A Little Princess) 

She used to find any way she could to prank the headmistress (sending love letters from strangers, putting tacks on her chair, putting worms in her food, etc.) 

Vivian spent a lot of time getting punished and locked in the garden shed for her bad behavior. Sometimes for a few days at a time until someone begged the headmistress enough to let her out. 

She was a big protector to the other girls. Sometimes she’d also take the blame for things she didn’t do because she felt strong enough to take the punishment (This was all from the age of 6-11). She’s been causing 

trouble for as long as she can remember 

○ One day when she’s 12, she sets part of the kitchen on fire and sneaks out of the orphanage. She stows away on a pirate ship (The [[Silver Fang]]). She flees out of the gulf. 

They try to throw her off, but she offers to work for free until they trust her. They agree to keep her on for the hard jobs, hoping she’d get sick of it and beg to be let off the ship. She’s a lot tougher than that though, and she loves being at sea. Most of the crew ignores her. The Captain, 

Captain Brigsby often makes harsh or gross comments to her, but she ignores them. 

They decide to give her the initiation. They abandon her on blood island for a week. She has to not only survive that long, but find something worth selling while on the island. The crew fully expect her to fail. She expects them to never come back 

● During that week, she scavenged for crabs, learned how to build a fire, and filter out salt water so she could drink it. It turned into two 

weeks and she definitely believed she was going to be stuck there 

forever. 

● She did decide to search for something valuable, but being a fairly bare island, she struggled. There weren’t any clear treasures. But

one day, she was walking through the trees and she noticed a tree that almost appeared to have red bark. She cut into it and it started to pour out red liquid. At first, she thought it was blood, but then she took a small taste and it tasted unlike anything she’d ever had before. She took out a bottle of alcohol she smuggled off the ship, emptied it, and filled it with the red liquid. 

● She drank some more and it didn’t have the same effect as alcohol. It gave her a euphoric feeling. More than being high or anything else. 

The crew did come back and when she gave the liquid to them to try, they discovered she did find something useful. They called it Devil’s Tear. They couldn’t really mass produce it because it only comes out of that one tree and no one wants to stay on Blood Island, but they harvested a few bottles worth and decided to sell it in small doses (more like shots) 

● They took a vote and begrudgingly agreed that she succeeded, so they branded her and let her stay on the crew (even though they still gave her a hard time) 

One member of the crew, Harland (ten years older than her, so 22 when she joins the crew), made sure she was fed and trained her when he had the time. She considered him like an older brother. When he accepted her, most of the crew did as well and at least left her alone. 

She worked her way up to a normal position and most of the crew put up with her, some of them even liked her. (All except for Brigsby- which she didn’t particularly mind. She didn’t care to get on his good side) 

This crew was known for smuggling spices to different countries and for diving for rare gems to sell on the black market. Brigsby is known to bite off more than he can chew and he’s almost gotten caught a few times. Whenever he has a big load, the crew gets nervous. 

They have a rival pirate crew that sails on the [[Phantom]]. (Their flag is a deep dark purple with a splatter of gray that looks like smoke). They are known for their diving expeditions and being heavy hitters in the gem trade. That’s why they hate the Silver Fang. They think they should stick to the spice trade and stay out of the gem business. They think Brigsby is dipping into other people’s territories. 

Vivian learned to dive and mine so that she could be a well rounded crew mate, able to step in to do any task. She often wasn’t trusted to do the diving, but she could if they let her. 

One night, when she was 18, the ship went through a huge storm and the captain was too drunk to handle it. Vivian stepped up and led the ship along with Harland, and they were able to save it, just barely. When the Captain stumbled out and angrily addressed her for stealing his ship, she grabbed his gun and shot him. 

A good portion of the crew left after this, but Harland and a few others stuck with her, thinking she could handle it. She struggled to find what

would make them money, but she eventually chose exotic spices, not 

wanting to deal with the Phantom, even thought she knows how to dive for gems. They sailed around, trading and collecting them. However, she was way in over her head. No one trusted her to run spices for them, and when they did, it wasn’t nearly enough. She’d steal as much as she could, but it was hard to find buyers. Eventually, she had to sell the ship as it was damaged from the storm and she couldn’t afford repairs. 

■ They dock in Rienos and they sell the ship. The crew leaves her at this point, but Harland leaves her with the message that she is cut out for this. She just needs to plan ahead, find her own ship, and make a name for herself. She plans on doing exactly that. She stays in Rienos, working odd jobs here and there and smuggling what she can. She’s done small jobs for different crews, but none of them keep her around. 

■ She did a diving/mining job for a new crew calling themselves the 

Northern Raiders. They were clearly a bunch of kids who found a small ship and decided they could make it big. They agreed to let her keep 

some of the money, so she agreed to the job. It was in Mixos. 

● The Phantom found them in their territory and decided to destroy 

their ship as a message. They killed almost the whole crew. One 

of the members of the Phantom recognized Vivian. She’s an elf 

named Shalia. They argued, but Vivian explained that she doesn’t 

have a crew anymore and took the job to survive. Shalia let her go 

and didn’t tell her crew that she saw Vivian. Vivian never 

understood why. 

● Vivian travels back to Rienos and stays away from diving or 

anything related to the pirate business for a while (as a thank you 

to Shalia) 

■ She eventually hears through the grapevine that Harland has been arrested and might be on the chopping block, so she sets out from Rienos to find him. The rumors say different things. He might be in Port Glory or he might be in San Rey. 

● Personality 

○ Chaotic Neutral 

○ Can be a bit of a hot head, but has a mantra to control herself 

■ Might choose not to use it very often though (likes to be a bit unhinged) ○ Blunt and honest, and a bit of a loud mouth, but quick to use that to her advantage. Very good at persuasion 

○ Won’t take shit (which often got her in trouble) 

○ Interested in the deep ocean and the creatures they lie within. Would love to sail the seas and find them (not necessarily to kill them, but our of pure curiosity and a love for all things fantastical) 

○ Swift, and could totally stab you in the back (won’t if she likes you and you’re on her good side)

○ Not interested in finding her parents or connecting with any family. She dreams of having a crew for a family. One that she can hand-pick and decide for herself, rather than trusting genetics. 

● Goals 

○ To get a ship of her own (she wants to name it the Scarlett Seadragon after her dreams, or to at least join a crew she can be proud of) 

○ Become the most infamous pirate in the nation 

○ To have a family she makes for herself (not necessarily in the way of having children, but in choosing who she wants to have in her life) 

○ To show off to Miss Mildred one day how successful she is (maybe by buying the orphanage and firing her) 

● Important Figures 

○ Mildred (Halfling woman who ran the orphanage. Don’t let her small stature fool you. She is a menace)

○ Harland (Triton man with a rich knowledge of maps and ships. He was the navigator for the Silver Fang)

○ Captain Brigsby (dead, but he was a half-orc and his right hand man was his son, [[Moruhn Brigsby|Moruhn]](pronounced More-une, but Vivian always called him Moron) is still alive and hates Vivian for what she did to his father. If he ever finds her, it’ll be very bad. She’s not afraid, but he will not be an easy one for her to kill. He’s not a wild drunk like his father.

○ [[Shalia]] (summer eladrin swashbuckler crewed on the Phantom. She helped Vivian escape) (Pronouns are she/they- Shalia is her chosen name. Shalia is transgender. She was born as Riardon. She found her home with the Phantom because they all accepted her for who she is.

○ [[Valhiri]] (Val for short- tiefling female captain of the Phantom. She is tough as nails, level-headed, but territorial. She takes her business very seriously because she knows that most men won’t take her seriously as a captain or competition (definitely a mistake) She leads an all female crew, something Vivian finds very inspiring. She’s never liked being on their bad side)

● Fun facts 

○ Sexuality = Lesbian. (no men ever, gross) 

○ She’s slightly claustrophobic from her time being locked in a shed. She’s able to pretend that it doesn’t bother her that much, but deep down, she really struggles with it 

○ Astrological Big three 

Leo sun: confident, ambitious, drama-loving, protective, luxury loving, can be selfish 

Gemini moon: curious, active mind, easily bored, social, entertaining ■ Sagitarrius rising: outspoken, energetic, lucky, opinionated, optimistic, adventurous. 

○ Learned to navigate from Harland, but she’s really bad at it (think Moana in the beginning of the movie) She just forgets she’s supposed to be doing something and then heads in the wrong direction for a while. She could lead a ship but definitely wouldn’t steer it 

○ Drink of choice is the old admiral (mix of gin, vermouth, brandy and lemon). She doesn’t have the money for it much anymore, so if she drinks, it's just plain gin. ○ She has a weird talent for whittling. She wittles little figurines when she’s stressed 

○ Has a necklace that is just a strip of leather with a silver butterfly hanging on it. She’s had it since she was a baby. It used to double loop around her head, but now it’s more of a choker. She still wears it though.
