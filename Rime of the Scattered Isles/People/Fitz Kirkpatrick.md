A former client of [[Minuet Donnediu]]'s  who became a friend and genuine lover of a sort. She believes him to be the steward of a minor Aegelene lord. In reality, he is the right hand of [[Killian Cane]], the Mad Dog of Cape Constance. Minuet has not seen Kirkpatrick since his "marriage." In fact he does not anticipate seeing her again because Cane lost his letter of marque after a raid gone too far for the taste of the Aegelene crown. As such the [[Red Tide]], along with the rest of Cane's fleet, will not be returning to [[Port Glory]] for the foreseeable future.

Fitz has a nose for suffering, having been through a great deal himself in his life. This is what drew him to Minuet (among...other things) and it's also what drove him to befriend [[Lyralai]]. As far as *she* knows, Fitz is a rum runner operating between Riena and Seahorse Island. He also serves as her **criminal contact**.
