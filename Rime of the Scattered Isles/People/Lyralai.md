Unlike her brother, Lyralai was not born into slavery. She has memories of a tropical island that she and her small tribe of banished Tieflings called home. She remembers the sounds of the beach and the soft pale red sand on  the shores. She remembers staying up too late watching the water and seeing the passing ships. She also remembers when the pirates came.

  

She was 5, playing around the village with some of the other kids. Soon the clouds rolled in, and so did the fleet. 10 ships strong, the pirates made landfall and quickly outnumbered the 50 or so occupants of the village. As soon as it started it was over. Each of the villagers was shackled and contained under the guard of the ruthless pirates. From the largest ship, a Goliath man walked down to the center of the captives and proclaimed “Congratulations, today you all have new lives of fulfilling work and adventure. I am Thalgal Sharpstone, the Cutlass of the Sea, and the captain of this band of warriors and thieves. The rules are simple. Do what you are told and do it well, and you will live a long life. Slack off, talk back or complain, and you will not do well here. Some of you will be traded to other leaders, but if you continue to follow those rules, you will do fine.The good news is you will all see wonderful places under wonderful owners. The bad news is you are now our property. Bad news for you, of course, for us, this is merely a great business opportunity.” The group was then separated onto the boats and shipped away, never to see their small island again.

  

Whether it be a blessing or a curse, Lyralai was born with charm and beauty. She got it from her mother Netari. The  blessing was that because of Netari’s beauty, she had more influence over the captain and crew, so she was able to keep herself and Lyralai on the same crew doing cleaning jobs while her husband Kyron and the others on her ship were responsible for running the sails and doing the more strenuous jobs. The curse is what was required for her to maintain this influence. Many nights in the captain's quarters resulted in a special place at the captain's side and after 2 years of this, Netari became pregnant. Enraged, Kyron confronted the captain and was quickly subdued. As punishment, he was traded off to a different ship in the fleet and later sold to a different crew. Netari became separated from Lyralai, and eventually gave birth to her new son, a half tiefling half goliath child named Kavalok Silverstone.

  

After Kyron was sold, the enslaved tieflings began to prepare a revolt against the captain and his crew. Some months of preparation passed, sneaking knives and firearms, and soon the night of action was upon them. Reaching an island to sell some treasures, the captain went to bed for the evening and the slaves armed themselves and began to assault the  pirates while half the crew was off the ship. The fight started with some success, and within minutes the slaves had control of the main deck with some of the pirates slain and some captive. From the captains quarters, Thalgal emerged with his trusted blade at one side and Netari holding Kavalok at the other. The slaves gave their demands and the captain stepped forward to address them. As he did, Netari walked around the crowd to where Lyralai was hiding. As captain Silverstone began to address the rebels, he quickly drew his blade and began to fight back. What the slaves failed to consider was the truly legendary status of the captain's swordsmanship. With just a few slashes half of the assailants were killed. With fear in her eyes, Netari looked to Lyralai and whispered “Run. Get as far inland as you can and stay hidden until we leave. No matter what you hear or see, keep running and hide well.” and Lyralai ran. As she got onto the docks, the rest of the crew came back from their deliveries. As Lyralai hid, she watched the slaughter of the entire assaulting force taken on single handedly by the captain. As he finished up he looked to his crew on the dock and yelled “Witness this, men! These worthless beings thought they could take me on in a scuffle! Little did they know, I am the best Swordsman on the Sea!”

  

The crew embarked on the ship and as if nothing happened, they sailed off, leaving Lyralai afraid and alone hiding in a crate on the docks. She was quickly discovered by some of the merchants and was fed and tended to. She was brought back to the merchant's crew, but before they got to safety, she snuck away and began her life on the street. She trained herself with sticks that she found to try and protect herself and used her natural charm from her mother to lie and convince people to do what she wanted. As she got older, she began to cycle around towns on the island and learn the ways of people. She eventually conned some sailors out of some money and was able to purchase some blades and began to practice her swordsmanship. From the day she got her blades, she channeled her hatred of pirates and her newfound skills and vowed to herself to do whatever she could to become the seas finest swordswoman and eventually find the Captain and defeat him at his own game, in a one on one sword duel, and free her mother and her brother, along with the rest of the enslaved crew of the fleet. 

  

Some years of training with her blades, training with her charm and using her beauty and people skills to do whatever it takes to get the information she needs to hunt down the captain, she is now 27 and determined to complete her goal. She seems like a charming sweet woman that anyone would be lucky to know, but her deep hatred of pirates and intense life on the street leads her to be merciless and truly emotionless inside. She has never cared for anyone truly because all of her adult life has been committed to completing her goal. 

  

Other notes

-   She fights with dual blades, but only uses the second blade when she feels it necessary. She likes to take on people with a single blade just to show her skill with her swords.
