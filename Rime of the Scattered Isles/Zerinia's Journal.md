	C.S. sent that fool of a half-elf to collect the first shipment today. One of Cate's castoffs and a half-orc street urchin who should grow up to be a fine field hand. Payment was not what I had hoped, of course, but it beats what I've been making running this pathetic little grog shop.

	Sleeping in the muck tonight. Those mongrel pirates ran me out of town, that bitch Cate at their head. Some drunk heard the halfling we grabbed last week making a racket in the cellar and gabbed to his friends and pretty soon Vara and Cate were banging down my door. "We don't brook slavers on San Rey." Blathering idiots. Somebody needs to clean up some of the riff-raff and give them a useful existence.

	I've been hearing things in the woods. I fear someone is stalking me. I happened across some ruins with an inscription in what I think is giant. The place is loathsome, all hewn stone and mushrooms, absolutely disgusting.

	The presence I had sensed has revealed itself. I feared it was some kind of jungle predator or one of the pirates; I had hoped it might be some kind of fae, if only to have *someone* to converse with. In fact it was a Firbolg of repulsive appearance. He calls himself Corum. I have been able to gain his confidence, as he may yet prove useful.

**16 Jun, 536 HII**
	My fortunes may be turning. I was able to get a message to C.S. and he sent one of his ships, the *Silver Falcon* to meet me on the eastern shore of the island. The captain was a young half-orc, but there was another lad there, even younger, with grey-blue skin. I took him for a half-drow. It turns out that Corum is but one of an entire society of Firbolgs living on San Rey. With their size coupled with their docility, they would make ideal slaves...aside from the matter of invisibility. I have learned from Corum, however, that this particular tribe's ability to turn invisible is linked to something they call "the source." If I can find some way to destroy this source, they will be vulnerable. 
	There's also the matter of transporting the creatures. The people of Toquemada will not simply allow a slave fleet to load captives in their harbor, and together they are a formidable enemy, even to one as powerful as C.S.

	I'm rather good at this. Some weeks ago, Corum showed me the source. I returned later to sully the thing, just enough for the Firbolgs to notice. Now I've convinced that oaf Corum that the people of Toquemada are to blame. 
	He has agreed to bring a pox upon Toquemada with my help. All I have to do is wait until the pirates have been weakened sufficiently and then destroy the Source completely. Then the Firbolgs will be exposed, and the island will be vulnerable. All that will remain is to send out the signal to summon C.S.
