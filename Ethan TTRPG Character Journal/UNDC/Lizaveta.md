Lizaveta Evandrea Temnon is the last of her family, her grandparents both having died in the years before her father's execution, her mother perishing in prison, and her brother, [[Rodia]], having recently been killed by the Shadowfront Garrison.

After being cast out on her own at age ten, Lizaveta, or "Evie," as her brother called her, spent the next several days fending off starvation by eating scraps off of plates at outdoor restaurants, until the serving staff started keeping an eye out for her and running her off before she could even get close. She then tried one of the soup kitchens run by the Church of Order, only to be refused because she wasn't a "Registered Destitute."

It was then she met Druse, a copper-skinned halfling with a wicked grin that concealed a kind heart. She thought he was another child at first, when he beckoned from a storefront across from the soup kitchen. As she approached she noticed the beard and thick eyebrows, the creased skin of middle-age. Normally she was wary of strangers, but something about Druse's manner as he glanced back at the soup kitchen and muttered "bastards" before giving her a gruff-but-kind "come on, kid" before setting off put her at ease.

Druse's family was a hub for a small group of social outcasts living in one of the capital's poorest sections. His older cousin, Erling, was the de facto leader of the family and thus the master of the house in general. Erling was dour where Druse was witty, and had a presence that loomed over even those in the house who were twice his stature. Erling's wife, Tera, was similarly dispositioned. Frugal, decisive, shrewd. Whatever horrors the two of them had seen gave had sharpened both their wills. They would not let the small niche they had carved for themselves and their makeshift family be compromised. 

Besides them there was Lorin, Druse's husband, a pale, doughy halfling who cobbled shoes and had a sweet, somber disposition; Halgar, an old goliath who recited poetry and spent most of his time outside in the house's courtyard (really a dank, muddy nook with a mossy table and a few chairs set off from the alley by a small stone wall) because he had to stoop so much inside; Erin, a half-orc orphaned by the wars in the east who had become a surrogate to the halfling family, though it was mostly Tera and Lorin who treated him with parental affection (their kindness had paid off: when Evie was introduced to the family, Erin had taken up a job at a brewery, and brought in nearly half the family's income); and Drina and Zina, goblin sisters (twins?) who seemingly did nothing but drink, bicker, and pester Halgar for weeks on end, before delving into the city's alleyways and sewers as if they were an enormous cave system and emerging with stolen loot of some sort, which Erling and Druse then managed to fence effectively enough that the authorities never took notice.

Evie spent just over a week with this chaotic assortment, but their strange kindness and love for one another made a lasting impression. One evening after dinner, Lorin, with a craftsman's curiosity, picked up Evie's boots to examine them. He remarked on the Dragonfly crest stamped on the upper heel of both boots, and Erling took notice. He put down the ledger he was looking through and stalked over to Lorin, snatching the boots and examining the crest on them. He then summoned Druse into a side room. Evie heard the murmur of their voices start and then rise: Druse yelled something, then Erling barked something else in return. Drina and Zina looked up from throwing dice on Halgar's chest, the goliath a makeshift couch stretched in front of the fire. Tera set down her knitting, cast a strained, weary glance toward the door, and began gathering apples, bread, and cheese in a small sack. She walked over to Evie and handed her the sack along with a small knife. She fixed an austere gaze on Evie, who thought that this halfling woman, three inches shorter than her and living hand-to-mouth, seemed more commanding and regal than her mother had in all her finery, "We help whom we can, girl. Else we risk not being able to help anyone. I am sorry for what happened to your family, and I am sorry you cannot stay." 

Halgar had a look on his face like he had just stubbed his toe and was trying not to curse. Drina and Zina were agape, while Lorin was weeping softly, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry" he said as he pressed Evie's hand and retreated through the back door into the courtyard. Evie hefted the bag, curtsied to Tera -- immediately feeling absurd -- and walked out the front door. She wasn't sure which way to turn on the muddy street. The tears came slowly, then all at once. Her father was dead, her mother imprisoned, and her brother likely shared one of their fates. And now she was alone again. Utterly alone. She sobbed in the moon-washed street while peddlers and drunks passed her by, most without giving her a second glance -- weeping children weren't uncommon in this neighborhood. Eventually, the door opened and Druse emerged, wrapping Evie in a hug. "I'm sorry, kid. I'm so, so sorry. Erling...Erling says we can't risk it. If the Church or the Hand, or, gods forbid, the Shadowfront Garrison were to learn that the child of a disgraced and disposed of Magistrate was living with a bunch of *undesirables* from parts unknown..." 

"There's no telling what they'd do," Evie sobbed. 

"Yeah," Druse breathed. "Listen," he said, stepping back and looking Evie in the eye, "You'll be alright, okay? Anybody tries to take that food Tera gave you, you show 'em that knife, you hear?" 

"How did you know she gave me a knife?"

"Because I know my cousin-in-law." He grinned through misty eyes. Suddenly he grew serious, "Come with me," he said. They walked through the muddy streets for a quarter of an hour until they reached the brewery where Erin worked. Erin was alone, tending fires and stirring wort. He often worked by himself at night so production could start off running in the predawn hours. He found Evie a place to sleep for a few hours, a warm nook near some fermenting barrels. Before Druse left, he hugged Evie again and said "Head down the river to [insert nearby city name]. They treat the poor with less contempt in the smaller cities. Make your way to Hallowood. If you can make it to Tsadarbu, find the temple by the marsh, and show the temple porter this," he held up an amulet. Blah blah amulet description. "Good luck, Evie."

A while before dawn, Erin woke Evie and stowed her in a makeshift boat made from a barrel. "It isn't much, but it's the best I can do. The city guards will have seen stranger things that this going down the river, but it's still best that you leave as they change shift. Not to mention my coworkers will be arriving soon."
